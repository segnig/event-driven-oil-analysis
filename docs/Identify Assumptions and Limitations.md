## From Conflict to Commerce: How Global Events Shift Brent Oil Pricess

#### üß† **Assumptions**

* We assume that significant geopolitical and macroeconomic events (e.g., wars, sanctions, OPEC decisions) can cause **sudden or delayed changes** in oil prices.
* We assume Brent oil prices are driven by **external global factors**, not just internal market behavior.
* The time series is modeled as a **stochastic process** with **regime shifts**‚Äîperiods where the statistical properties (like mean or volatility) of the price change.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**

* **Correlation does not imply causation**: While change points may align with real-world events, we cannot prove those events caused the changes.
* Not all change points will match known events‚Äîsome may result from **market speculation, investor sentiment**, or **data noise**.
* We are using **only Brent oil price data**. Without incorporating other variables (e.g., supply/demand, inflation, stock market trends), we may **miss the broader economic context**.
